<h3 class='info underline'>What is superpower?</h3><br>
<p style='padding-right:50px;padding-left:50px;line-height:30px;'>Superpower is defined as a power in which a computer is
the object of the superpower (hacking, phishing, spamming) or is used as a tool to commit an defence(person's
self-defence or other people). ... Super Warriors who perform these legal activities are often referred to as 
defenders.The development of adequate legislation and within this approach the development of a
super power legal framework is an essential part of a super security strategy. This requires first of all the
necessary substantive our law provisions to define acts such as computer fun, legal access,
data protection, copyright protection and person's defenders. The fact that provisions exist in the
Super Army code that are applicable to similar acts committed outside the network does not mean that they
can be applied to acts committed over the Internet as well.Therefore, a thorough analysis of current
our rules is vital to identify any possible gaps. Apart from substantive Super Army provisions, the
Sper agencies need the necessary tools and instruments to investigate Super Power. Such
investigations themselves present a number of challenges.Agents can act from nearly any location
in the world and take measures to mask their identity. The tools and instruments needed to investigate
Super Power can be quite different from those used to investigate ordinary Power.
